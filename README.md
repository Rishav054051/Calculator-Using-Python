# Calculator-Using-Python
Here I am going to make Calculator using puthon and implementing GUI to it.
<br>
üöÄ Excited to share my First project - a fully functional calculator built using Python and Tkinter! üéâ
<br>
üîç With this project, I delved into GUI programming and honed my skills in Python development. From designing the user interface to implementing the logic behind calculations, it's been an enriching learning experience.
<br>
**Functionalities :**
<br>
**1.** Basic Arithmetic Operations: Users can perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**2.** Keyboard Input Support: The calculator supports keyboard input, allowing users to input numbers and operators directly from their keyboard for faster calculations.

**3.** Clean and Intuitive Interface: The calculator features a clean and user-friendly interface designed for ease of use and intuitive navigation.

**4.** Error Handling: The calculator includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid inputs or mathematical errors, providing a smooth user experience.

**5.** Dynamic Expression Display: The current expression being entered or evaluated is dynamically displayed on the screen, keeping users informed and engaged throughout their calculation process.

**6.** Parentheses Support: The calculator allows users to input and evaluate expressions containing parentheses, enabling complex calculations and mathematical expressions.

**7.** Responsive Design: The calculator GUI is designed to be responsive and adaptable, ensuring optimal usability across different screen sizes and resolutions.

üí° Looking forward to continuing my journey in software development and exploring new projects. Stay tuned for more updates!
